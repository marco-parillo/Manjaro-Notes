I was once a complete newbie to Linux, and I was following some instructions, and I noticed some minor errors in the documentation. Even though I was a Linux newbie, I had plenty of experience in Corporate IT, so I knew what a well-written "Test Problem Report" looked like, and, of course, I had read http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html, so instead of ineffectual whining, I created an account on the project's bug tracker, and opened a bug, thinking good bug reports differentiate indirect contributors from newbie users. But instead of fixing the bug, the primary maintainer, responded, "It's a wiki". So instead being an indirect contributor, I became a direct contributor. After a few wiki updates, I was invited to push to the project repos, and I was having my pushes accepted (sometimes after a bit of feedback). Short story: It is not that hard to make a contribution; you just have to see a problem that you can help address.
